In a certain country populated predominantly by wizards, there is an impending demonstration that needs careful planning to ensure it meets specific requirements.\n\nThere is a population of n individuals within the city, of which x are wizards committed to attending the demonstration. The remaining (n - x) individuals, non-wizards, have no intention to participate. The city administration will acknowledge and act upon the demonstration only if it engages at least y percent of the total city population. To meet this criterion, wizards are considering the creation of clone puppets that will stand in for the non-wizards at the demonstration.\n\nImportantly, the administration cannot distinguish between real individuals and the clone puppets when calculating participation percentages. They will treat the city's population as n for this calculation, completely unaware of the existence of any clones.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of clone puppets the wizards must create to ensure that the demonstration involves no less than y percent of the original city population n.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line of input includes three space-separated integers, n, x, y (1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104, x ≤ n) — representing the total number of city residents, the number of wizards, and the percentage required by the administration, respectively.\n\nIt should be noted that y can be a value exceeding 100 percent, meaning the administration might require a demonstration crowd size greater than the city’s actual population.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of clone puppets that need to be created to ensure the demonstration meets or exceeds y percent of n (the city's true population size).\n\nExamples:\n\nInput\n\n10 1 14\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n20 10 50\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nInput\n\n1000 352 146\n\nOutput\n\n1108\n\nNote:\n\nIn the first example, to meet the requirement that at least 14% of 10 people (which rounds up to 2) attend, the lone wizard would need to create one clone.\nIn the second example, all 10 required participants are wizards, so no clones are necessary.\nIn the third example, the requirement is for 1460 attendees, so with 352 wizards, an additional 1108 clone puppets are required.
